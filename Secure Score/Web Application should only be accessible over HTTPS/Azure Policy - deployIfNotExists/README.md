# Azure Policy - deployIfNotExists
This Azure Policy definition will ensure that during the creation of new Web Applications, HTTPS will be enabled. Also it will enable you to create a remediation task which will change the Web Application setting to enable HTTPS.<br>

After the deployment, you need to assign it and set the desired scope.
